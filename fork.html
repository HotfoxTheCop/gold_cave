	<p>You took a big leap into the cold water below. After being submerged into the freezing water for a few seconds, you quickly swim up, catching your breath. A ton of questions start buzzing through your head: Why did I do that? Why is this water so cold? Was a tiny shimmer that worth it to be submerged in this awfully cold water?</p>
	<p>You started to get a gathering for your surroundings. All you could see in front of you was a waterfall, filling the cave with the noises of rushing and dripping water to your left. To your right, another cave with a bright golden light bursting out of it.</p>
	<p>You swam closer to the waterfall. It looked like there was a little passage under it. If you got a big enough breath, you could swim over to the other side. If there was one. The golden cave on the other hand was lighting up the whole cave! The glimmer of something you saw on the surface was most likely coming from there.</p>
	<p>Decisions, decisions...</p>
