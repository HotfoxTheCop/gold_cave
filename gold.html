	<p>You swam your way to the shimmering cave. Coming up to a ledge, you see in front of you a massive pile of coins! There must be millions of coins in here! You try and fit as many as you can into your pockets. These must be worth a fortune!</p>
	<p>As you filled your pockets to the brim, you went back into the water, keeping your newly found riches from falling out into the underwater floor below. As you tried climbing back to the top of the cave, a coin fell out onto a ledge. You went back to pick it up and accidentally stepped on it as it... leaked brown slime? You took a closer look at the substance and noticed it was... <b>chocolate?!</b> You took the rest of the coins out of your pocket and saw there was a small ridge on all of them. As you peeled them back one by one, you saw they were <i>all</i> chocolate coins. As disappointed as you were, you were just as confused. What kind of nutjob would leave a pile of millions of chocolate coins in a random cave in the middle of the woods??</p>
	<p>You dropped the rest of the coins into the water below and continued your climb out of the cave, back to your family with nothing but wet clothes and pockets lined with wet chocolate. What an uneventful endeavor...</p>
