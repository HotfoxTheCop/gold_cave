	<h2>Summer 1994</h2>
	<p>School's out and you're spending time with your family! Your parents decided to get in touch with nature and take a trip to the great outdoors. No electricity, technology or any sort of connection to civilization. What more could you want? You help set up camp and your dad lets you roam free just so long as you get back before sundown. On your little expedition, you find a couple cool rocks, a few giant sticks. You see a snail climb up a tree! Very. Slowy. But entertaining nonetheless.</p>
	<p>You walk a few more yards past the snail tree and stumble upon... a cave? Weird thing to find out in the woods but, cool! You walk to the edge, looking at the water below. You're about to walk back to your camp when you swore you saw a glimmer of something on the water bellow...</p>
	<p>Maybe it's nothing... but what if it isn't? Only one way to find out!</p>
