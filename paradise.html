	<p>You come out of the cave, the sun beaming down on your face and the feeling of... seaweed at your feet?</p>
	<p>You were suddenly at a beach, the most beautiful beach you had ever seen! The sky was clear, the water was as blue as could be and the sand was nice and soft. It was paradise! But, as you walked to the shore line, many, <i>many</i> questions ran though your mind. How do I get back to the campsite? How is it nowhere near sunset? How do I get back to my family? They're probably worried sick. What happened to all those cool rocks I found?</p>
	<p>But as you came to the shoreline, your feet digging into the sand as the waves washed over them, you didn't really care. There didn't seem to be a sign of any kind of life around besides the seaguls that flew over head every so often. This was nice. Your own personal beach, seemingly in another part of the world. It was relaxing. You knew you would eventually have to figure out how to get back to the woods but, that was a problem for the future. You sat on the beach, laying back with the sun shining down on your face.
