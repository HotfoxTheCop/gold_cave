	<p> After taking as big as a breath you could, you dove underneath the waterfall. You kept swimming as fast as you can, seeing some kind of light at the end of this tunnel. After almost two minutes of holding your breath and swimming as hard as you could, you reached surface finally! You caught your breath and gathered your surroundings again. There wasn't a whole lot of light coming in this time and the source of it was at the end of this new cave. As you walked towards the light, you could hear the sounds of seagulls and the crashing of waves...</p>
